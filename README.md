# Magic Wand

This is an Arduino based project using Tensorflow's example sketch for magic_wand. I am using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense.

## Installation Instructions:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:aknowles18/magic-wand.git
$ cd magic-wand
```

## To run:
1. Open `magic-wand` in Arduino IDE.
2. Verify and Upload the sketch to the board. 
3. It should begin running almost immediately.
